First csv data are imported into R. Then proper formatting of time column is used with `strptime` function. Then the difference between consecutive time points is calculated (`diff` function) aa well as cumulative difference in seconds. Finally non-linear fit is performed (with a,k, and b) parameter using function `nls`. Model coefficient can be extracted by `coef` function. Finally life time can be obtained from k value `tau= (log(2)/k)/3600`, and observation points with model curve can be plotted. By using function `with(data, expr, ...)` that is a generic function that evaluates `expr` in a local environment constructed from `data`

```r
library(zoo)

#load data

BC <- read.delim("D:/002_R_PROJECTS/2013_09_01_Beam_Current/BC.txt")

#deal with time column
#time difference between the points
z1 <- strptime(BC$Hour, "%H:%M")
dif1=diff(z1)
#cumulative difference in seconds 0 added at the beginning
dif2=data.frame(c(0,60*cumsum(as.numeric(dif1))))
colnames(dif2)=c("time")
BC1 <- data.frame(as.numeric(dif2$time), BC$BC)
colnames(BC1)=c("time","BC")
#non-linear fit
model1 <- nls(BC ~ a*exp(-k*time)+b,data=BC1, start=c(a=240, k=0.0001, b=12)) 
summary(model1)
model.cf <- coef(model1)
a <- model.cf[1]
k <- model.cf[2] 
b <- model.cf[3]  

tau= (log(2)/k)/3600
print(tau)

with(BC1, plot(BC~time))
with(BC1, lines(time, a*exp(-k*time)+b, col="red", lwd =2))
```
