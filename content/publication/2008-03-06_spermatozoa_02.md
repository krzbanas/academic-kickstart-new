abstract = "Further progress in the biology of male reproductive cells of farm animals requires the search for more objective methods of evaluating their viability. The ability of magnetic resonance diffusion measurements to study flow processes and cell movement in boar spermatozoa suspension was investigated. Diffusion measurements were carried out with a Bruker magnet system (4.7 T) operating at a 1H resonance frequency of 200.11 MHz. The stimulated echo aquisition mode technique was used and echo attenuation curves with an observation time delta between 50 and 600 ms were recorded. In the spermatozoa suspension a biexponential diffusion occurs. Diffusion coefficients for fast and slow components were calculated. The values of the diffusion coefficient for the fast-decaying component in fresh spermatozoa samples are much higher than those for any other sample. The assumption that it is associated with the spermatozoa motility is worth further investigating."
