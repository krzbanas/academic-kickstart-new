abstract = "The evaluation of spermatozoa motility, viability and morphology is an essential parameter in the examination of sperm and in the establishment of correlations between sperm quality and fertility.Until now, assessment of sperm quality has been based on subjective evaluation of parameters, such as motility and viability, and on objective parameters, such as semen concentration and morphology abnormalities. When subjective optical microscopic evaluation was used in humans and animals, variations of 30 to 60% have been reported in the estimation of the motility parameters of the same ejaculates. Pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) techniques have been presented here to demonstrate the potential to study flow and transport processes in complex systems. In this paper we present the results of PFG-NMR obtained for a number of samples of boar spermatozoa and discuss whether this method can be useful for fast and reliable spermatozoa motility evaluation."
