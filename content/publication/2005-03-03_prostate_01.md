abstract = "To understand the role of trace elements in the oxidative stress, which may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, we investigated the distribution and chemical state of Fe using synchrotron radiation. Therefore, both synchrotron radiation induced X-ray emission (SRIXE) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) techniques have been applied to study cancerous and non-cancerous prostate tissues. The results obtained in this work prove that SRIXE and XANES techniques are complementary ones for analysis of trace elements in biomedical samples. The absorption K-edge position of iron determined in cancerous tissue is shifted by 2.9 eV towards higher energies in comparison to iron absorption K-edge determined in non-cancerous tissue. The information obtained in this way may help to understand the role of oxidation state of iron in the oxidative stress underlying the oncogenesis."
