abstract = "On the basis of the proton NMR relaxation time dependencies on temperature and frequency in cellulose pulp a simple two-motion model of molecular dynamics has been proposed. The parameters, activation energies and correlation times, describing the model may be correlated with structure features such as level of crystallinity of cellulose with different origin, as well as degree of paper devastation."
