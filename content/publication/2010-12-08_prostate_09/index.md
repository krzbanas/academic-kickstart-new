abstract = "*Zinc is decreased in prostate cancer: an established relationship of prostate cancer!* â€” this is the title of the critique of our paper [1], published in this volume. According to the authors (Costello and Franklin), we presented our results concerning zinc concentration *in the context of refutation of the established relationship showing widespread recalcitrance and/or lack of knowledge within the clinical and biomedical research community for recognition that zinc decrease[s] in prostate cancer.* In fact, our initial motivation for the analysis of manganese, iron, copper, and zinc concentrations in prostate cancer tissues was based on the lack of established relationships of these elements with prostate cancer development. In our paper we showed only results of our work and stated: *It is clear that further studies with a larger number of tissue samples must be performed to consolidate the present conclusions*. We did not claim that our results should be treated like dogma, so it is really incomprehensible why we deserved such an aggressive critique."
